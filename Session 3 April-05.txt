Why Cloud:
pay as you go
scalibelty
Remote exxeciablity

Benifets of Cloud:

01.automatice back and SW update
02.automation of task
03.better storage
04.cost effective
05.dister recover and lost prevension
06.gieo redundetnt
07.high security
08.hilighly felxible
09.low mentanence and zero resik failuer
10.remote exxeciblity
11.sclablity

Tyope of cloud
1. public cloud
	That is available publicly, any cloud which is payble 
2. private cloud
	That is only for particular company for its employee
	owned by single orginization
3. Hybrid cloud
	Make use of both public and private
4. Comunity cloud
	one of more combine private cloud

Type of cloud services:
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) (Eg Virtual machine) (***Zoom Car)
	Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
	Users manage operating systems, applications, and storage while the cloud provider manages the underlying infrastructure.
	Examples:
		Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
		Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
		Google Compute Engine

2. Platform as a Service (PaaS) (Eg Server with select application)(***Uber )
	Offers a platform that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without managing infrastructure.
	Includes tools for development, databases, and application hosting.
	Examples:
		AWS Elastic Beanstalk
		Azure App Services
		Google App Engine
		

3. Software as a Service (SaaS)	(External Selected application)
	Delivers fully functional software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
	Users only interact with the application, while the provider manages everything else.
	Examples:
		Microsoft 365
		Google Workspace (Docs, Gmail, Drive)
		Salesforce

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)		
ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)		
EL  (Extract, Load)		
1. Stages of ETL Process
	Extract
		Retrieves data from various sources (databases, APIs, cloud storage, etc.).
		Common sources: SQL/NoSQL databases, CSV/Excel files, cloud applications, APIs.
		Example tools: SQL queries, APIs, web scraping.
		
		
		
		
		
		Q2D 

	Transform
		Cleans, formats, and enriches data (removing duplicates, converting data types, aggregating).
		Common operations: filtering, joining datasets, calculating new metrics.
		Tools: Python (pandas), SQL transformations, Apache Spark, Azure Data Factory (ADF).

	Load
		Moves transformed data into a target system like a data warehouse (Azure Synapse, Snowflake).
		Methods: Full load (all data) or Incremental load (only new/updated data).
		Example tools: SQL scripts, batch jobs, streaming pipelines.

2. On-Premises & Enterprise ETL Tools (For large-scale, secure environments)
	? Informatica PowerCenter – Robust ETL tool with high-performance data integration.
	? Microsoft SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) – ETL tool for SQL Server environments.
	? IBM DataStage – Enterprise ETL for complex data transformation.
	? Talend Data Fabric – Hybrid ETL for cloud & on-prem.		

1. Cloud-based ETL Tools (Managed services, scalable)
	? Azure Data Factory (ADF) – Microsoft’s cloud-based ETL tool for building data pipelines.
	? AWS Glue – Serverless ETL tool from Amazon Web Services.
	? Google Cloud Dataflow – ETL service using Apache Beam.
	? Snowflake Snowpipe – Continuous data ingestion tool.

IR: Intrigration Runtime
Type of Intrigration Runtime
	
	1. Azure Integration Runtime (Azure IR)
		? Fully Managed by Microsoft – No infrastructure management required.
		? Best for Cloud-to-Cloud Data Movement & Transformations.
		? Supports:
	Copying data between cloud data stores (Azure Blob, Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, etc.).

	2. Self-hosted Integration Runtime (Self-hosted IR)
		? Installed on a Virtual Machine (VM) or an On-Premises Server.
		? Best for Hybrid Scenarios: On-Prem to Cloud or Cloud to On-Prem.
		? Supports:
	
	Copying data from on-premises SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, etc. to Azure.
	
	3. Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (Azure-SSIS IR)
		? Managed Compute for Running SSIS Packages in Azure.
		? Best for Migrating SSIS Workloads to Azure Without Rewriting.
		? Supports:
	
	Running ETL workflows built in SSIS without modifying them.
